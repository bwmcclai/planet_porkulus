# Porkulus - Industrial Tundra Mod for Factorio Space Age

**The industrial heart of the galaxy—keep them warm, keep them healthy.**

Porkulus is a "Sub-Zero Industrial Tundra" planet mod designed for Factorio's Space Age expansion. It transforms the world into a massive, planet-sized factory farm where thermal management and biosecurity are the keys to survival and industrial dominance.

## 🪐 Planet Profile: Porkulus

*   **Theme**: Sub-Zero Industrial Tundra.
*   **Aesthetic**: Slate-grey rocks covered in "Biological Frost" with organic pinkish-hue runoff.
*   **Atmosphere**: A dense, high-pressure industrial haze clashing with perpetual snowfall.
*   **Gravity**: 12 m/s² (Slightly heavier than Nauvis).
*   **Solar Power**: extremely low (15% effectiveness), pushing players toward nuclear or geothermal energy.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics: The Three Pillars

### I. Thermal Management ($T$)
Unlike other planets, Porkulus structures (Piggeries) have a strict **Thermal Operating Range**. 
*   **Freezing (<10°C)**: Production stops completely.
*   **Optimal (18°C - 25°C)**: Standard production speed.
*   **Heat Stress (>35°C)**: Quality drops rapidly and disease risk increases.
*   **Logistics**: You must utilize **Heat Pipes** and **Thermal Radiators** to maintain the "Goldilocks" zone. Map-traversal is aided by **Thermal Veins**—natural hotspots (20°C - 30°C) where early-game survival is possible without advanced heating.

### II. Vaccine Loop (Biosecurity)
As you scale up industrial pig production, the risk of "Swine Flu" increases.
*   **Contamination**: A unique meter tracks the biological risk level of your factory.
*   **Vaccine Production**: Requires Chemical Plants to synthesize **Organic Sludge**, **Ammonia**, and specialized vials.
*   **Effect**: Piggeries must be continuously supplied with Vaccines. Failure to do so increases the "Spoilage" rate of pigs by 500%.

### III. Quality Tiering
Pig quality is a direct result of your farming precision:
*   **Normal**: Basic pork and biomass.
*   **Uncommon/Rare**: Achieved by maintaining perfect 20°C temperature and 100% Vaccine coverage.
*   **Legendary**: Requires "High-Grade Feed" processed from specialized flora.
*   **End-Game**: High-quality pigs are processed into **Bio-Computers** or **Nutrient Paste** to provide massive buffs to the player.

## 🗺️ Map Layout & Resources

| Zone | Feature | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Thaw** | Starting Area | Features Thermal Veins and Sludge Pits for early-game heat and resources. |
| **The Frost Barrens** | Ores & Ice | Iron and Copper deposits are "Cold-Locked"—drills require Heat Shields to function. |
| **The Ammonia Seas** | Liquid Ammonia | Used for advanced cooling, vaccine synthesis, and propulsion. |
| **The Gristle Crags** | Frozen Bio-Matter | Mined to create "Slop" to feed the pigs. |

## 🏗️ Unique Structures

*   **Industrial Piggery**: A massive 5x5 facility where pigs are grown and processed. Requires Feed, Vaccines, and a Heat Connection.
*   **Thermal Radiator**: Disperses heat into the surrounding area to prevent nearby belts and inserters from freezing.
*   **Bio-Scanner**: A circuit-enabled gate that reads the Quality and Health of items on a belt, allowing for automated sorting of high-tier bio-products.

## 🚀 Installation & Compatibility

1.  Place the `porkulus` folder in your Factorio `mods` directory.
2.  Enable **Space Age** and **Porkulus** in the in-game mod manager.
3.  **Any Planet Start**: This mod is fully compatible with "Any Planet Start." You can select Porkulus as your homeworld for a challenging geothermal-industrial start.
