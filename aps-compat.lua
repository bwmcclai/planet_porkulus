-- Amazonia compatibility for Any Planet Start
-- This file is loaded by any-planet-start when Amazonia is selected as starting planet

-- Amazonia is relatively similar to Nauvis (jungle planet with normal resources)
-- so we don't need extensive tech tree modifications

-- No special technology modifications needed for now
-- Amazonia has normal ores, trees, and water, making it viable as a starting location
