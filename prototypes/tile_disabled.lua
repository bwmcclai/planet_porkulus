-- Amazonia Tiles
-- Using simplified tile definitions that inherit from base tiles

-- Simple approach: Just use base tiles for now to avoid collision mask issues
-- Custom tiles can be added later with proper Factorio 2.0 tile API

-- For now, we'll skip custom tiles and let the planet use default terrain
-- This avoids all the collision_mask format issues in Factorio 2.0

-- Placeholder - tiles disabled for now to avoid errors
-- Re-enable once we understand Factorio 2.0 tile collision mask format better
